# shunting-yard-algorithm
This project is meant to be an implementation of the shunting yard algorithm. The main goal is to be able to calculate the value of an expression in infix notation by converting it into RPN which is trivial to calculate.
TODO:
- Come up with a way for the linter to single out operators so that unary operators do not break the linter (Potential idea to explore is to have unary operators only possible if they are not a suffix of another operator + being single character to make it easier)
